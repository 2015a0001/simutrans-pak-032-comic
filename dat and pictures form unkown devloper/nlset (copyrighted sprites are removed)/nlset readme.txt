Dutch Trainset .pcx-file

Contains graphics of Dutch Trains pasted over the DBset .pcx-file. All original DB-vehicles are removed because of copyright reasons. 

The Thalys from tempset was included too, but is removed also because of copyright reasons.

This is not a final .pcx-file, this is only a try to put my graphics into TTD.
